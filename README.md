# Tennis Court Booking App

This project is a Flutter application designed to allow users to manage the booking and scheduling of three tennis courts.

## Overview

The primary goal of this application is to provide a user-friendly interface for booking time slots on three different tennis courts. The application implements a clean code architecture, focusing on separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

## Features

-   **Court Booking:** Users can view available time slots and book sessions on three distinct tennis courts.
-   **Scheduling Management:** The application handles the scheduling of bookings, preventing double bookings and managing time slot availability.
-   **User Interface:** The user interface is designed according to the provided Adobe XD design, ensuring a consistent and intuitive experience.
-   **Clean Code Architecture:** The application follows a clean code architectural pattern, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend.

## Architecture

This project utilizes a Clean Code architecture. Key principles of this architecture include:

-   **Separation of Concerns:** The application is divided into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities.
-   **Dependency Rule:** Inner layers have no knowledge of outer layers. Dependencies point inwards.
-   **Testability:** The architecture promotes testability, allowing for thorough testing of individual components.
-   **Maintainability:** The clear separation of concerns and well-defined boundaries make the codebase easier to maintain and evolve.
-   **Scalability:** The modular design allows for easy addition of new features and components.

## Design

The application's UI/UX design is based on the following Adobe XD prototype:
